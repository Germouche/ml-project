## Data  
We have signed a non disclosure agreement, so we cannot share the datasets that we have used

## Tabular Model
We have used a random forest to deal with the tabular datas, the complete pipeline including the preprocessing can be found in Random_forest.ipynb  

## Image Model
We have used a Convolutional Neural Network to deal with this task. The notebook containing every steps (model + preprocessing using the data given to us) is images.ipynb

## Text Model
we have different models to deal with different languages textual information, german_bert.ipynb is for german, french_bert.ipynb is for french, italian_bert.ipynb is for italian. in all of three files, in the beginning I made a language classification, to generate a new dataset with language tag.
then we will take different language's textual information into its indicated model.
## Multimodal 
We have used a NeuralNetwork to deal with this task taking as input both images and mormalised tabular data. The notebook containing every steps (model + preprocessing using the data given to us) is Image+tabular.ipynb
